          <p>
            I've worked as an intern database administrator for two different companies. While I was at CJSR, I was in charge of setting up a database and transferring over data that was previously stored in one big excel document. When I worked for All Weather Windows, I researched several database monitoring tools and I created a program that queried their Oracle database automatically, as that work was done by hand before.

            In addition to my DBA skills, I am also a proficient programmer. I know C, C++, Perl, Python, and Java. I've also created several mobile apps for Android, and in addition to several websites.
