Modifications
=============

Some HTML pages already had CSS styles defined so I had to remove them.

The communist manifesto had a problem with headers. It had
h1, h3, h4, and h5, so I had to move the last three one position down to
match up meaning with the other documents.

I had to alter some title headers from h2 to h1 because some documents
used h2 for chapter titles and for a continuation of the title of the
document.
